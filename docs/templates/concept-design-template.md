## Design Challenge

How might we [reframe the opportunity as an open-ended question that invites creative solutions]?

## Success Criteria Recap

From the opportunity brief, success means:
- [Key outcome 1]
- [Key outcome 2]  
- [Key outcome 3]

## Concept A: [Descriptive Name]

### Core Insight
[One sentence that captures the essence of this approach]

### Mental Model
**How users think about it**: [User's description in their own words]  
**Analogy**: [Familiar metaphor - e.g., "Like a shopping cart for ingredients"]  
**Fit with existing mental models**: [How it extends what they already understand]

### Key Behaviors Enabled

1. **[Primary User Action]**
   - User does: [Specific action]
   - System responds: [What happens]
   - User benefit: [Why this matters]

2. **[Secondary User Action]**
   - User does: [Specific action]
   - System responds: [What happens]
   - User benefit: [Why this matters]

3. **[Tertiary User Action]** *(if needed)*
   - User does: [Specific action]
   - System responds: [What happens]
   - User benefit: [Why this matters]

### Information Architecture

**New User-Facing Concepts**:
- **[Concept Name]**: [What users understand it to be]
- **[Concept Name]**: [What users understand it to be]

**Relationships**:
- [Concept A] contains [Concept B]
- [Concept C] references [Concept D]

**Vocabulary**: 
- Users will see terms like: [term 1], [term 2], [term 3]
- We avoid technical terms like: [term to hide]

### Interaction Flow

```
1. Entry Point: User sees [where/when this appears]
   ↓
2. Primary Action: User can [main thing they do]
   ↓
3. System Feedback: Shows [what changes/updates]
   ↓
4. Secondary Actions: User can now [follow-up options]
   ↓
5. Success State: User sees [confirmation/result]
```

### Key UI Moments

**Moment 1: [First Contact]**
- What user sees: [Description]
- Why it works: [Design rationale]
- Emotional response: [How user feels]

**Moment 2: [Core Interaction]**
- What user sees: [Description]
- Why it works: [Design rationale]
- Emotional response: [How user feels]

**Moment 3: [Success/Completion]**
- What user sees: [Description]
- Why it works: [Design rationale]
- Emotional response: [How user feels]

### Trade-offs

**Gains**:
- ✅ [What becomes easier]
- ✅ [What friction disappears]
- ✅ [What new capability emerges]

**Losses**:
- ⚠️ [What becomes more complex]
- ⚠️ [What flexibility is reduced]
- ⚠️ [What edge case is harder]

**Risks**:
- ❓ [What might confuse users]
- ❓ [What could go wrong]
- ❓ [What needs careful design]

| **Learning Curve** | [How easy: Immediate/Quick/Moderate] | [How easy] | [How easy] |
| **Feature Completeness** | [What %  of needs met] | [What % of needs met] | [What % of needs met] |
| **Error Prevention** | [How well it prevents mistakes] | [How well] | [How well] |
| **Flexibility** | [How adaptable to edge cases] | [How adaptable] | [How adaptable] |
| **Technical Complexity** | [Rough estimate: Low/Medium/High] | [Estimate] | [Estimate] |

## Domain Implications Preview

Initial thoughts on how this concept affects the domain model:

**Likely New Concepts**:
- [Domain concept that might emerge]
- [Domain concept that might emerge]

**Concepts Needing Evolution**:
- [Existing concept]: Will need to [change]
- [Existing concept]: Will need to [change]

**Behavioral Changes**:
- When [user action], system must [domain behavior]
- [Event type] will need to capture [new data]
