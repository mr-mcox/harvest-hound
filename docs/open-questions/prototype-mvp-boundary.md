# Prototype vs MVP Boundary

**Discovered**: recipe-generation experiment, 2025-11-29
**Uncertainty**: Low (will emerge naturally from prototype learnings)
**Architectural Impact**: N/A (meta-question about process, not architecture)
**One-Way Door**: No (decision can be made when ready)

## Observation

Single page getting us pretty far

## Questions

- When do we stop prototyping and rebuild for MVP?
- What's the signal that we understand the domain well enough?
- How much of this prototype code is throwaway vs salvageable?

## Note

Let prototype discovery guide this naturally
