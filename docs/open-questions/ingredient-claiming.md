# Ingredient Claiming as Negotiation

**Discovered**: recipe-generation experiment, 2025-11-29
**Priority**: Low (can defer)

## Hypothesis

Claiming might be more complex than simple decrement

## Questions

- Is claiming always "exact match or fail"?
- Or is it negotiation? ("I need 2 lbs carrots, I have 1.5 lbs, that's probably fine")
- Who decides if partial ingredients are acceptable? (user? AI?)
- Can AI suggest substitutions on-the-fly during claiming?
- How does this relate to Store types (explicit vs definition)?

## Next Experiment

Set up edge cases and explore claiming behavior
