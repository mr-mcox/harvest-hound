# Performance Observation Checklist: WebSocket Real-time Updates

## Browser Dev Tools Setup

### Essential Tabs to Monitor
- **Network Tab**: WebSocket connection health, message frequency
- **Console Tab**: JavaScript errors, WebSocket events
- **Performance Tab**: Memory usage, CPU spikes during updates
- **Elements Tab**: DOM mutation patterns during real-time updates

### Network Tab Monitoring

#### WebSocket Connection Health
- [ ] **Connection Status**: Look for `WS` entries showing established connection
- [ ] **Connection Timing**: Initial handshake < 100ms
- [ ] **Message Frequency**: Check for message spam or missed events
- [ ] **Reconnection Behavior**: Verify clean reconnection after interruption

#### Message Inspection Points
- [ ] **Event Size**: Individual WebSocket messages < 1KB typically
- [ ] **Event Structure**: Well-formed JSON with expected event types
- [ ] **Event Ordering**: Sequential timestamps, no out-of-order delivery
- [ ] **Error Messages**: No WebSocket close codes indicating problems

### Console Tab Monitoring

#### Expected Log Patterns
```javascript
// Good patterns to see:
WebSocketService: Connected to ws://localhost:8000/ws
InventoryStore: Received InventoryItemAdded event
EventBus: Publishing event to subscribers

// Warning patterns (investigate but not critical):
WebSocketService: Reconnecting attempt 1
WebSocketService: Connection lost, retrying...

// Error patterns (critical issues):
WebSocket connection failed
Unhandled error in event processing
State synchronization conflict detected
```

#### JavaScript Error Monitoring
- [ ] **No TypeScript Errors**: Clean compilation, proper type safety
- [ ] **No Event Handler Errors**: WebSocket message processing succeeds
- [ ] **No State Conflicts**: Store updates don't create inconsistent state
- [ ] **Memory Leak Indicators**: No growing object counts in memory profiler

### Performance Tab Monitoring

#### Memory Usage Patterns
- [ ] **Baseline Memory**: Initial page load < 50MB heap usage
- [ ] **Memory Growth**: Gradual increase during operation < 1MB/minute
- [ ] **Memory Cleanup**: Periodic garbage collection visible
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: No continuous growth without plateau

#### CPU Usage Patterns
- [ ] **Idle CPU**: < 5% when no updates occurring
- [ ] **Update Spikes**: Brief CPU spikes (< 100ms) during real-time updates
- [ ] **Reconnection Cost**: CPU spike during reconnection < 200ms
- [ ] **Background Processing**: Minimal CPU usage between user actions

#### Rendering Performance
- [ ] **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60fps during real-time updates
- [ ] **Layout Thrashing**: No excessive reflow/repaint during updates
- [ ] **Animation Smoothness**: Connection status indicators animate smoothly
- [ ] **List Performance**: Large inventory lists update without jank

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Time Targets
- **WebSocket Connection**: < 100ms to establish
- **Event Delivery**: < 50ms from backend event to frontend display
- **Reconnection Time**: < 5 seconds for automatic recovery
- **Bulk Update Processing**: < 500ms for 100 inventory items

### Resource Usage Limits
- **Memory Footprint**: < 100MB total for single-tab usage
- **Network Bandwidth**: < 10KB/minute for idle connection
- **CPU Usage**: < 10% average during active usage
- **DOM Nodes**: < 5000 nodes for largest inventory views

## Stress Testing Scenarios

### High-Frequency Updates
**Setup**: Rapidly add/remove inventory items
**Monitor**: 
- [ ] Message queuing behavior in Network tab
- [ ] CPU spikes in Performance tab  
- [ ] Memory allocation patterns
- [ ] UI responsiveness degradation

### Large Data Sets
**Setup**: Load store with 500+ inventory items
**Monitor**:
- [ ] Initial page load time
- [ ] Scroll performance in inventory lists
- [ ] Memory usage for large DOM trees
- [ ] WebSocket message processing speed

### Connection Instability
**Setup**: Simulate network interruptions every 30 seconds
**Monitor**:
- [ ] Reconnection attempt frequency
- [ ] Memory usage during reconnection cycles
- [ ] Event queue processing after reconnection
- [ ] User experience during unstable connections

## Red Flags - Stop Testing If Observed

### Critical Performance Issues
- Memory usage growing > 10MB/minute continuously
- CPU usage > 50% sustained during normal operation
- WebSocket message delivery > 1 second consistently
- Browser tab becomes unresponsive for > 2 seconds

### Critical Functional Issues
- WebSocket connection fails to establish
- Real-time updates stop working without error indication
- State synchronization creates duplicate or missing items
- Connection recovery fails after network restoration

## Performance Optimization Opportunities

### If Updates Feel Slow
- [ ] Check WebSocket message batching opportunities
- [ ] Verify efficient DOM update patterns
- [ ] Consider debouncing high-frequency updates
- [ ] Review event processing pipeline bottlenecks

### If Memory Usage High
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup of event listeners
- [ ] Check for retained references to DOM elements
- [ ] Review WebSocket message history retention
- [ ] Monitor garbage collection frequency

### If CPU Usage High  
- [ ] Profile JavaScript execution during updates
- [ ] Check for excessive DOM queries/mutations
- [ ] Review event processing algorithms
- [ ] Consider virtual scrolling for large lists
