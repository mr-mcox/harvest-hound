# Manual Testing Guide

This document provides comprehensive manual testing scenarios for Harvest Hound, focusing on real-world usage patterns and edge cases that complement our automated test suite.

## Overview

Manual testing is essential for:
- **Real LLM Integration**: Testing actual AI parsing behavior with diverse inputs
- **Performance Validation**: Measuring real-world response times under various conditions
- **Edge Case Discovery**: Exploring scenarios that automated tests might miss
- **User Experience**: Validating the complete user workflow end-to-end

## Test Environment Setup

### Option 1: Real LLM Testing
Use actual LLM services for comprehensive testing:
```bash
# Start with real LLM configuration
./scripts/test-manual.sh
```

### Option 2: Mocked LLM Testing
Use mocked responses for consistent baseline testing:
```bash
# Start with mocked LLM for predictable results
./scripts/dev-start.sh
```

## Core Workflow Tests

### Test 1: Basic Store Creation & Inventory Upload
**Objective**: Verify the fundamental user workflow works end-to-end

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to application home page
2. Click "Create New Store"
3. Fill in store details:
   - Name: "Weekly CSA Box"
   - Description: "Fresh vegetables from local farm"
   - Infinite Supply: false
4. Click "Create Store"
5. Verify store appears in store list
6. Navigate to inventory upload page
7. Paste inventory text: "2 lbs carrots, 1 bunch kale, 3 medium tomatoes"
8. Click "Upload Inventory"
9. Verify parsing results appear within 30 seconds
10. Check inventory table shows 3 items with correct quantities

**Expected Results**:
- Store creation completes in < 1 second
- Inventory parsing completes in < 30 seconds
- All items correctly identified and quantified
- No errors or crashes

### Test 2: Multiple Stores with Separate Inventories
**Objective**: Ensure inventory isolation between stores

**Steps**:
1. Create store "CSA Box" with inventory: "2 lbs carrots, 1 bunch kale"
2. Create store "Pantry" with inventory: "1 cup rice, 2 cans beans"
3. Navigate between stores
4. Verify each store shows only its own inventory
5. Add more items to each store
6. Refresh browser and verify data persists

**Expected Results**:
- Each store maintains separate inventory
- No cross-contamination between stores
- Data persists across browser refreshes

### Test 3: Complex Inventory Parsing
**Objective**: Test LLM parsing with diverse input formats

**Sample Inputs to Test**:
```
Mixed formats:
2 lbs carrots, 1 bunch kale, 3 medium tomatoes, 1/2 cup olive oil

Inconsistent spacing:
2lbs carrots,1   bunch kale,   3medium tomatoes

Partial quantities:
half a bunch of kale, couple of tomatoes, some carrots

Multiple languages/terms:
2 lb carrots, 1 bunch of kale, 3 roma tomatoes, 1 head lettuce

Ambiguous items:
green stuff, root vegetables, leafy things
```

**Steps**:
1. Create test store
2. Upload each sample input separately
3. Review parsed results
4. Note any parsing errors or misinterpretations
5. Document unexpected behaviors

**Expected Results**:
- 90%+ accuracy on common formats
- Graceful handling of ambiguous inputs
- Clear error messages for unparseable content

## Performance Testing

### Test 4: Large Inventory Upload
**Objective**: Test system performance with substantial inventory

**Steps**:
1. Create store "Large Farm Share"
2. Upload comprehensive inventory (50+ items):
```
2 lbs carrots, 1 bunch kale, 3 tomatoes, 1 head lettuce, 2 bunches spinach,
1 lb potatoes, 3 onions, 2 bell peppers, 1 bunch cilantro, 1 head cabbage,
4 zucchini, 2 cucumbers, 1 bunch radishes, 1 pint cherry tomatoes,
1 bunch parsley, 2 eggplants, 1 lb green beans, 3 ears corn,
1 head broccoli, 1 head cauliflower, 2 leeks, 1 bunch scallions,
1 lb beets, 1 bunch turnips, 1 acorn squash, 1 butternut squash,
1 bunch swiss chard, 1 head bok choy, 1 bunch arugula, 1 head radicchio,
2 fennel bulbs, 1 bunch dill, 1 bunch basil, 1 bunch oregano,
1 bunch thyme, 1 bunch rosemary, 2 heads garlic, 1 piece ginger,
1 lb apples, 1 lb pears, 1 pint strawberries, 1 lb grapes,
2 avocados, 3 bananas, 1 pineapple, 1 cantaloupe, 1 watermelon,
1 lb walnuts, 1 lb almonds, 1 cup sunflower seeds
```
3. Measure parsing time
4. Verify all items are correctly parsed
5. Test inventory display performance

**Expected Results**:
- Parsing completes in < 45 seconds
- All items correctly identified
- Inventory display loads in < 2 seconds
- No performance degradation

### Test 5: Concurrent Usage Simulation
**Objective**: Test system under concurrent load

**Steps**:
1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Create different stores simultaneously
3. Upload inventory in each store at the same time
4. Monitor for conflicts or errors
5. Verify all data is correctly saved

**Expected Results**:
- No data corruption
- All stores maintain separate state
- Reasonable performance under load

## Error Handling Tests

### Test 6: Network Interruption Handling
**Objective**: Test graceful error handling

**Steps**:
1. Start inventory upload
2. Disconnect network during upload
3. Reconnect network
4. Retry upload
5. Verify error messages are user-friendly

**Expected Results**:
- Clear error messages
- Ability to retry failed operations
- No data loss or corruption

### Test 7: Invalid Input Handling
**Objective**: Test system robustness with edge cases

**Test Cases**:
```
Empty input: ""
Non-food items: "2 lbs rocks, 1 toy car, 3 pencils"
Nonsense text: "alkdfjlaksjdf laksjdf laskjdf"
Very long text: [1000+ character string]
