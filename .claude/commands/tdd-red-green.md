Implement $ARGUMENTS using strict red-green TDD:

1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
   - Test the behavior, not implementation
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Ensure tests actually fail

2. **GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass
   - Don't optimize yet
   - Focus on making tests pass

3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
   - Extract methods/classes
   - Remove duplication
   - Improve names

Commit at each phase. Run tests before each commit.
