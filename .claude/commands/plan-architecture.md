Think hard about the domain architecture for this feature: $ARGUMENTS

Use Domain-Driven Design principles:
- Identify bounded contexts
- Define aggregates with clear boundaries
- Focus on behavior over data
- Use event sourcing patterns where appropriate

Create a structured plan but don't implement yet.

When creating implementation tasks, distinguish between:

- **Setup Tasks**: Create foundational elements that enable development/testing
  - Mark as "No tests needed - setup only"
  - Examples: class stubs, SQL schemas, route definitions, basic UI components
  - Purpose: Enable other code/tests to import, reference, or build upon
  - Implementation: Minimal setup with NotImplementedError for method bodies

- **Behavior Implementation Tasks**: Add business logic through TDD
  - Mark as "Tests needed"
  - Purpose: Make the setup actually work with real functionality
  - Implementation: Test-driven with RED/GREEN/REFACTOR

For each component, first ask:
1. What setup do other components need to import/depend on?
2. What behavior needs to be tested and implemented?

Create setup tasks for #1, test tasks for #2.
