Create a detailed implementation task plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these principles:
- **Red/Green TDD Approach**: Focus on observable behavior that can be tested
- **Distinguish Testing Levels**: Separate basic class definitions (no tests needed) from meaningful behavior (tests required)
- **Concrete and Specific**: Tasks should be actionable, not abstract concepts
- **Testable Outcomes**: Each test should specify exact inputs and expected outputs

Task Structure:
1. **Class Definitions** - Mark as "No tests needed" when just creating data structures
2. **Behavioral Tests** - Specify exact test cases like "Parse '2 lbs carrots' â†’ {'name': 'carrots', 'quantity': 2.0, 'unit': 'lbs'}"
3. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end user workflows
4. **Success Criteria** - Observable outcomes that validate the feature works

Save the plan as `docs/development/tasks-ACTIVE.md` with clear task groupings and testable behaviors.
