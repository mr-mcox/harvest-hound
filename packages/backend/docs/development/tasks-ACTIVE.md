# Active Development Tasks

## Current Status: Test Quality Improvement - COMPLETED ✅

The core test quality improvement initiative has been **successfully completed**. All major objectives achieved:

### ✅ **Completed Phases (All Done)**

#### Phase 1: Database Integration Fix - COMPLETED
- ✅ Fixed projection registry sharing issue (root cause of test failures)
- ✅ Created singleton global registry for proper event sourcing
- ✅ All database integration tests now pass consistently

#### Phase 2: Integration Test Consolidation - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Consolidated 4 integration test files into 1 comprehensive file
- ✅ Removed 625 lines of code while maintaining complete coverage
- ✅ All 18 integration tests pass with zero @patch decorators

#### Phase 3: Architecture Cleanup - COMPLETED
- ✅ Removed placeholder and redundant files
- ✅ Removed legacy compatibility layer  
- ✅ Additional 511 lines of code removed

#### Phase 4: Typing Foundation - COMPLETED
- ✅ New integration tests are fully typed and pass strict mypy
- ✅ Zero @patch decorators achieved in comprehensive integration tests
- ✅ Proper dependency injection architecture implemented

## Current Phase: Legacy Unit Test Typing - IN PROGRESS

### Overview
With typing overrides removed, we now have 10 legacy unit test files that need typing annotations. These are primarily missing return type annotations on test functions and fixtures.

### Files Requiring Typing Work

| File | Status | Primary Issue |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `tests/test_api_behavior.py` | ✅ **CLEAN** | No typing errors |
| `tests/test_dependency_injection.py` | ✅ **CLEAN** | No typing errors |
| `tests/test_domain_behavior.py` | ✅ **CLEAN** | No typing errors |
| `tests/test_integration_comprehensive.py` | ✅ **CLEAN** | No typing errors |
| `tests/test_utils.py` | ✅ **CLEAN** | No typing errors |
| `tests/test_event_store.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_eventstore_projections.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_projection_handlers.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_projection_registry.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_read_models.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_repositories.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_schema_export.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_store_service.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_translation.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |
| `tests/test_view_stores.py` | ❌ **NEEDS WORK** | Missing return type annotations |

### Strategy: Incremental File-by-File Approach

**Current Approach**: All typing overrides have been removed and we're fixing all remaining files at once.

**Priority**: The errors are primarily missing `-> None` return type annotations on test functions and fixtures. These are straightforward to fix.

### Next Steps

1. **Add return type annotations** to the 10 files with typing errors
2. **Focus on test functions and fixtures** that need `-> None` annotations
3. **Verify each file** passes mypy individually as work progresses
4. **Run full test suite** to ensure no functionality is broken

### Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero typing overrides** - All test files pass strict mypy checking
- ✅ **Zero @patch decorators** - Maintained in comprehensive integration tests  
- ✅ **Full test coverage** - All functionality preserved during typing improvements
- ✅ **Consistent patterns** - All test files follow same typing conventions

## Overall Project Status

### Major Achievements
- **1,136 lines of code removed** while maintaining full functionality
- **Database integration issues resolved** - event sourcing working correctly
- **Test reliability improved** - consistent test passing with proper dependency injection
- **Architecture cleaned up** - removed placeholder and redundant code
- **Type safety enhanced** - new integration tests pass strict mypy checking

### Current Work
The remaining work is straightforward typing annotation cleanup that will complete the test quality improvement initiative. All major architectural and functional improvements have been successfully implemented.
